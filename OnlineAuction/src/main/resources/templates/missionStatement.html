				friends over the internet. The goal is to provide a fun and secure
				environment for everyone to participate in exchanging goods for
				goods or goods for currency.</p>
				<p>We don't agree with big industry and we
				want to run this shop on the bare minimum - meaning we don't price
				gouge and we aren't interested in your data. The sole mission is to
				provide this service with transparency so our users can shop online
				hassle free.</p>
